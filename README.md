# smart-visitor
 
- This project focuses on creating a smart visitor recognition system that provides notifications to the owner through the Internet whenever a person comes at the door
- When a person comes at the door, camera sensor captures his/her image and sends it to the ML face recognition module
-  It recognises the face of the user with any of the allowed members and matches the entry timing
